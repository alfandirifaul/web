                        Kellogg’s, leading American producer of ready-to-eat cereals and other food products. 
                        Kellogg’s Corn Flakes was one of the earliest and remains one of the most popular breakfast 
                        cereals in the United States. Headquarters are in Battle Creek, Michigan.
                        The company was founded as the Sanitas Food Company in 1900 by the brothers W.K. Kellogg and 
                        Dr. John H. Kellogg, who together had developed a method of producing crunchy, flavourful flakes 
                        of processed grain that proved a popular breakfast food among the patients at Dr. Kellogg’s Battle 
                        Creek Sanitarium. W.K. Kellogg eventually bought out his brother and in 1906 established the Battle 
                        Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company. Through innovative advertising techniques and improvements in the 
                        quality of the cereals, the company prospered. The present name was adopted in 1922 after the company 
                        began making cereals other than cornflakes.
